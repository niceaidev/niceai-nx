# Frontend Applications

Create all applications here. Multiple interfaces can be
developed sharing same codebase (packages)

Example:
1. Progressive Web Apps
2. Desktop Apps (Electron)
3. Lighter Version of Apps
4. Mobile First Apps
5. CLI Apps

### Create React Apps

```bash
pnpm create vite pwa
```

## Benifits
As all the applications share same codebase, it would be easy
to push updates and patches to all at once. It will also improve
consistency across apps and platforms.
